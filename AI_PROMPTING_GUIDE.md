## Understanding AI Capabilities and Limitations

### ✅ What AI Can Help You Do

1. **Code Generation**: Write widgets, screens, and business logic
2. **Debugging**: Identify and fix errors in your code
3. **Learning**: Explain Flutter concepts and APIs
4. **Refactoring**: Improve code structure and quality
5. **Problem Solving**: Suggest solutions for technical challenges
6. **Documentation**: Generate comments and documentation
7. **Testing**: Write unit and widget tests

### ⚠️ What AI Cannot Do (or Struggles With)

1. **Understanding Your Full Vision**: AI needs clear, detailed descriptions
2. **Complex UX Decisions**: Needs guidance on design choices
3. **Running Your App**: Cannot test the app directly (you must run it)
4. **Accessing External Services**: Cannot set up accounts, APIs, or keys
5. **Making Subjective Decisions**: Needs your input on preferences
6. **Understanding Latest APIs**: May have outdated information (check docs)

### 💡 Tips for Success

- **Be Specific**: Vague requests get vague results
- **Iterate**: Start simple, then refine with follow-up prompts
- **Verify**: Always test the code AI generates
- **Learn**: Ask AI to explain what it's doing
- **Reference Docs**: Point AI to Flutter documentation when needed

## General Prompting Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Context**

❌ **Bad**: "Add a button"
✅ **Good**: "I'm using the min-flutter-template. I want to add a button to MyHomePage that navigates to a new screen."

### 2. **Be Clear About Your Goal**

❌ **Bad**: "Make it better"
✅ **Good**: "Improve the error handling in my login function to show user-friendly messages using SnackBar."

### 3. **Specify Constraints**

❌ **Bad**: "Add a database"
✅ **Good**: "Add local storage using SharedPreferences for storing user preferences. Keep it simple for a small app."

### 4. **Provide Existing Code When Relevant**

✅ **Good**:
```
Here's my current main.dart code:
[paste code]

I want to add functionality to [specific goal]. 
How should I modify this?
```

### 5. **Ask for Explanations**

✅ **Good**: "Please explain what each part of this code does so I can learn."

### 6. **Request Step-by-Step Instructions**

✅ **Good**: "Give me step-by-step instructions to implement this feature, including which files to modify."

### 7. **Iterate and Refine**

Start broad, then get specific:
1. "I want to build a todo list app"
2. "Add ability to mark todos as complete"
3. "Store completed todos locally"
4. "Add a filter to show only incomplete todos"
