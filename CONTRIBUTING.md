- Consider backward compatibility
- Keep the template minimal and general-purpose

### Pull Requests

2. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow existing code style
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
4. **Test your changes**:

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use Dart for all application code
- Follow [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use Flutter best practices and widget composition
- Keep dependencies up to date but stable
- Maintain null safety throughout
- Use const constructors when possible

### What to Contribute

**Good contributions:**
- Bug fixes
- Security updates
- Documentation improvements
- CI/CD workflow enhancements
- Dependency updates
- Better default configurations

**What to avoid:**
- Adding app-specific features
- Including opinionated state management libraries
- Complex architectural patterns
- UI/UX customizations
- Domain-specific code

### Keeping It Minimal

This template should remain:
- **Minimal**: Only essential files and dependencies
- **General**: Not specific to any app domain
- **Modern**: Using current best practices
- **Documented**: Clear and helpful documentation
- **AI-Friendly**: Easy to customize with AI assistants

### Testing Guidelines

Before submitting a PR:

- [ ] Build succeeds: `flutter build apk`
- [ ] Tests pass: `flutter test`
- [ ] Code analysis passes: `flutter analyze`
- [ ] Code is formatted: `dart format .`
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Changes are backward compatible

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Brief summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what changed and why, not how.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
```

### Version Updates

When updating versions:

1. Check compatibility
2. Update version in appropriate file
3. Test the build
4. Update documentation
5. Note breaking changes

### Documentation Updates

Keep these files in sync:
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent/automation documentation
- `TESTING.md` - Testing procedures
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - This file
